# 🌌 Kori
Kori is an anime recommendation system written in Python, built using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.

### � Project Structure

- `/src`: Main source code of the recommendation system (all core logic and modules)
- `/docs`: Project documentation (including LaTeX files and generated PDFs)

---
### ✨ Features
- Recommends anime titles based on user input and content similarity
- Utilizes TF-IDF for text vectorization and similarity calculation
- Integrated search system using external APIs for up-to-date anime information
- Allows users to view episodes info of the selected anime
- Modular and extensible codebase
- Easy to use and adapt for other recommendation tasks

### 🧑‍💻 Technologies
- **Httpx**
- **NLTK** 
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**

### 📚 How It Works
1. The system processes a dataset of anime descriptions.
2. Each description is transformed into a TF-IDF vector.
3. When a user search and selects an anime, the system calculates the similarity between the query and all anime in the dataset.
4. The most similar anime are recommended to the user.
